image captioning (IC)-  is the task of automatically generating a textual description for a given image.

segmentation -  image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as image objects). ... Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images.

Object detection - is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos.
